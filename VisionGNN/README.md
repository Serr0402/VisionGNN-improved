# Vision Graph Neural Networks: A Replication Study

This repository aims to replicate the ["Vision GNN: An Image 
is Worth Graph of Nodes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00272) paper.

You could find my report [here](docs/main.pdf).

## Quick Start

First, install the requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the dataset using the following script:
```
./get_dataset.sh
```

You can train the model and view the results using the following command:
```
python3 train.py
```
